# Retail Pricing Optimization

## Overview
Retail pricing optimization is a critical aspect of retail management that involves setting prices for products to maximize profitability. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to optimize retail prices based on various factors such as competitor analysis, customer segmentation, and historical sales data.

## Project Objectives
- Explore and analyze retail data to understand product sales patterns and trends.
- Conduct competitor analysis to gain insights into pricing strategies used by competitors.
- Perform correlation analysis to identify relationships between different features and unit prices.
- Analyze month-wise sales data to understand seasonal variations and trends.
- Develop machine learning models to predict optimal prices for retail products.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and interpret the results.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical sales data for retail products, including features such as product attributes, sales quantities, prices, competitor prices, and customer information.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing and visualizing the dataset to gain insights into product sales, pricing, and customer behavior.
2. **Competitor Analysis:** Analyzing competitor prices and strategies to inform pricing decisions.
3. **Correlation Analysis:** Identifying correlations between features and unit prices to understand their impact.
4. **Month-wise Sales Analysis:** Analyzing sales patterns and trends over time.
5. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
6. **Model Creation:** Developing machine learning models to predict optimal prices for retail products.
7. **Model Interpretation:** Evaluating model performance and interpreting the results to make informed pricing decisions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Scikit-learn

## Model Creation
Utilized the Random Forest Regressor algorithm for predicting optimal prices for retail products.
### Why Random Forest Regressor?
- Robust to outliers and noise in the data.
- Handles large datasets with high dimensionality.
- Provides feature importance scores for interpretability.

### Results Interpretation
After training the Random Forest Regressor model, the following metrics were obtained:
- Train R2 score: 0.992
- Test R2 score: 0.962
- Train Mean Absolute Error: 4.059
- Test Mean Absolute Error: 9.333

The high R2 scores and low mean absolute errors indicate that the model effectively predicts optimal prices for retail products.

## Conclusion
Retail pricing optimization is a critical aspect of business strategy. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer behavior, market trends, and pricing strategies. This project demonstrates the application of data science in optimizing retail prices, ultimately leading to improved profitability and competitiveness.
